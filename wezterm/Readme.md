# Important

- For the wezterm configuration, I used this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5c5ucQvKOA) as a reference.
- All the lua files are located in a .config/wezterm in windows.
- In order to wezterm to open WSL by default
  - Add the `WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` variable in the user environment variables in windows
  - This variable needs to point to the base **_wezterm.lua_** config
