# MB dotfiles ⚙️

This repository contains my configuration files for my terminal & shell of choice. Feel free to add it to your own dotfiles.

- [.zshrc](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) (zsh configuration)
- [starship.toml]() (customizable shell prompt)
- [wezterm.lua]() (terminal)

## Requirements

- I use WSL (ubuntu), so there are some configurations that only works in this environment, also i like to keep some config in windows, i only have everything related to my shell in WSL.
- Nerd Font (it's for the icons) in my case i use [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
